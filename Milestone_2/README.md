# UVSim

## Description
UVSim is a simple virtual machine designed to help computer science students to learn about machine language and 
computer architecture. This software simulator allows students to execute machine language programs written in 
BasicML on the UVSim. The UVSim works with words, which are signed four-digit decimal numbers (e.g., +1234, -5678). 
It has a 100-word memory, and these words are referenced by location numbers 00, 01, ..., 99.

## Prerequisites
- Download the latest version of Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ with your corresponding OS and run the installer.
- Download any files you would like to use with the UVSim program.

## Installation
1. Download the UVSim project file. This can be done by clicking "<>code", "Download ZIP", and then unzip the file.

## How to Run
1. If you're on Windows open the Command Prompt or PowerShell, if you're on macOS or Linux open the Terminal.
3. Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your Python file is located. Ex. (cd path/to/your/directory)
4. Use the python command (or python3 on some systems) followed by the name of the program: Ex. (python uvsim.py)
5. Once open, the program will prompt you for input, asking for a file path and file name.
6. Provide the path and name of the BasicML file you want to execute and press the enter key.
7. The program will read the file and perform each operation until it halts or encounters an error.
