# UVSim

## Description
UVSim is a simple virtual machine designed to help computer science students to learn about machine language and 
computer architecture. This software simulator allows students to execute machine language programs written in 
BasicML on the UVSim. The UVSim works with words, which are signed four-digit decimal numbers (e.g., +1234, -5678). 
It has a 100-word memory, and these words are referenced by location numbers 00, 01, ..., 99.

## Prerequisites
- Download the latest version of Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ with your corresponding OS and run the installer.
- Download any files you would like to use with the UVSim program.

## Installation
- Download the UVSim project file. This can be done by clicking "<>code", "Download ZIP", and then unzip the file.

## How to Run
1. Make sure all the required modules (Standard Python Library) are accessible in the Python environment where you intend to run this program.
2. Execute the Python file using a Python interpreter. You can do this by running python main.py in your terminal or command prompt.
3. GUI Window: After running the command, you will be taken to the UVSim GUI application interface.
4. Interacting with the GUI: Within the GUI window, you can interact with the program by clicking the provided buttons.

## File Management 
The UVSim Emulator allows you to manage program files by doing the following:
1. To load a program file, click on the "File" menu and select "Open New File". Choose the desired program file from your system.
2. To save a file, click on the "File" menu and select "Save file as". Choose the location and name for the file.

## Editing Files
You can edit program files directly within the UVSim Emulator by doing the following:
1. Once a file is loaded or created, you can edit its contents in the text editor provided.
2. Make your desired changes to the code.
3. Use the "Save file as" button to save your changes.

## Running Programs
The UVSim Emulator allows you to execute programs and simulate computer operations by doing the following:
1. Ensure you have a valid program file loaded.
2. Click on the "Run" button to execute the program.
3. Monitor the output in the output console.
4. Use the "Stop" button to halt program execution.

## Customization
The UVSim Emulator provides options for customizing the user interface by doing the following:
1. Click on the "Themes" menu in the top bar to select from predefined color themes.
2. For advanced customization, click on the "Custom" theme option and follow the prompts.

## Exiting the UVSim Emulator 
The program can be exited in several ways depending on your operating system and how the application is running:
1. Close the Web Browser: If you are running the UVSim Emulator in a web browser, you can simply close the browser window or tab containing the application. This will terminate the program.
2. Terminate the Python Process: If you started the UVSim Emulator using a Python script (main.py), you can terminate the program by stopping the Python process.
- On Windows: You can press Ctrl + C in the command prompt window where the Python process is running.
- On macOS or Linux: You can use the Ctrl + Z or Ctrl + C keyboard shortcuts to send a termination signal to the Python process.
